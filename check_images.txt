Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three models classified the dog in Dog_01.jpg as English Foxhound, so there were no differences in breed classification for this image.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The breed classifications for Dog_02.jpg are incorrect for AlexNet and VGG. ResNet correctly classified it as a Doberman.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Frog_01.jpg (Frog):
            ResNet: Correctly classified it as Frog.
            AlexNet: Correctly classified it as Frog.
            VGG: Correctly classified it as Frog.
        Coffee_mug_01.jpg (Coffee Mug):
            ResNet: Incorrectly classified it as a Measuring Cup (not a dog).
            AlexNet: Incorrectly classified it as a Beaker (not a dog).
            VGG: Incorrectly classified it as a Paper Towel (not a dog).


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I would choose ResNet as the best model for classifying the images. It correctly identified Dog_02.jpg as a Doberman and accurately classified the frog and coffee mug images as not dogs. While there were some breed misclassifications (English Foxhound for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg), ResNet was the most accurate overall, especially in identifying non-dog images. In comparison, AlexNet and VGG both misclassified Dog_02.jpg as non-dog objects, which made them less reliable.
